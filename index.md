# Markdown Practice
## CSE 15L Lab 2

The purpose of this file is to *experiment* with editing markdown. We have a wide variety of formatting options, like **this**!

> If I were citing a long quote, it can show up as
> a block quote like this! It is useful for big
> blocks of text.

We've got ordered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

And unordered lists:
- Something
- Something
- Something

Here's some code (in Python)!
`print(Hello World!)`
